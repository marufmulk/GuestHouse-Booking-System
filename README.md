## Repository Structure Note for Docker Compose
For `docker compose up --build` to locate all service directories correctly using the relative build contexts, ensure that all three repositories (`GuestHouse-Booking-System`, `GuestHouse-Customer-Service`, `GuestHouse-Review-Service`) and your infrastructure repository (`GuestHouse-Infrastructure`) are placed within the same parent folder like this:

```text
📁 parent-folder/
├── 📁 GuestHouse-Infrastructure/  (contains docker-compose.yml)
├── 📁 GuestHouse-Booking-System/
├── 📁 GuestHouse-Customer-Service/
└── 📁 GuestHouse-Review-Service/
